# Thought about Go programming language

## Basics

Each program in Go should have a `main` package defined with a `main` function inside.
Each test infunction in Go should start with capital `T`, `Test` word.
This confuse me a little bit:

- why then `main` function is not `Main`?
- or why test function could not start with `test` instead `Test`?
